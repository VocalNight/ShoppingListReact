# ShoppingListReact

### Another small project for the CSharpAcademy.
Project can be found here: https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/37

This time i tried using the minimal API setup from .NET to know how it works and also because this was a very simple CRUD application.
No difficulties in this one, i remembered a few things already about react, so it was mostly smooth sailing once the data was flowing between the two projects.

I also tried to get used to react testing with this one since the amount of components is small. Took me a while (because the lack of decent tutorials and documentation, again) to get it, but i think i tested everything in the application that mattered!

### Starting the server 

Use 'npm start'

### Running tests
